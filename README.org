This directory contains minimal exe stuff for gofer on windows

[Thanks Sikander Tamboli for an early compile]

1. =pug.exe= of course needs to be on your path (or call with absolute path)
2. You need to set the environment variable =PUG= to the path of the chosen prelude;
   
   eg. =set PUG=Z:/path/to/pug/langlevels/pug.pre= before starting =pug64=.
